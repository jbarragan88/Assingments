    <h1>Ninjas</h1>
    <p>A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び) was a covert agent or mercenary 
        in feudal Japan. The functions of the ninja included espionage,
         sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.[1]
          Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed
           dishonorable and beneath the samurai, who observed strict rules
            about honor and combat.[2] The shinobi proper, a specially
             trained group of spies and mercenaries, appeared in the
              15th century during the Sengoku period,[3] but antecedents
               may have existed as early as the 12th century.</p>
